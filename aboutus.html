      <h2>About This Website</h2>
      <p>This website was build by five girls in the Girls Who Code summer program in an effort to help bring their generation to understand and inform them about good causes to help in this world. The website was build in seven days by these five girls as their final project. They had to learn new ways to code such as Bootstrap which is a code that helps build mobile friendly sites and building databases for all the content they were storing such as all the senators' information and the ability to upload and store pictures for memes.</p> 
      <h2>Our Women In Tech</h2>
      <p>At the beginning of our final projects, we were told to choose a women in tech to inspire our projects.  We chose Janisha Gabriel, a woman that has been a pioneer in social justice.  She helped create Haki Creatives, an organization that helps grassroots companies and small businesses rebrand themselves and create an image for themselves</p>
